## Bootstrap Button Example
`buttons.js` contains the css directly lifted from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), and transformed into simple JavaScript objects.

`primaryButton.js` is the equivalent of `btn-primary`. It's just a `button` with new properties merged in.

  1. `npm install`.
  2. `npm run build`.

Goodbye CSS preprocessors.
